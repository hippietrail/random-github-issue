# Random GitHub Issue

![dice GitHub dice](github-logo-with-dice.png)

## Overview
A simple web app that lets you fetch random issues from GitHub repositories. Just input a repository owner/name pair, roll the dice, and view issues in haphazard manner.

## Features
- Input field for entering the repository in the format `owner/repo`.
- Fetches random issues and displays them as clickable links.
- Clear button to reset the output.

## Misfeatures
- Doesn't scroll up when the issues fill up the window because that's hard to code and even even the LLMs can't do it!

## Usage
1. Enter the repository name in the input field (e.g., `microsoft/TypeScript`).
2. Click the dice button to fetch a random issue.
3. Click the clear button to reset the output.

## Technologies Misused
- HTML
